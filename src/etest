Parliament Does Not Support Amendment Freeing Tymoshenko
Today , the Ukraine parliament dismissed , within the Code of Criminal Procedure amendment , the motion to revoke an article based on which the opposition leader , Yulia Tymoshenko , was sentenced .
The amendment that would lead to freeing the imprisoned former Prime Minister was revoked during second reading of the proposal for mitigation of sentences for economic offences .
In October , Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into what was reported to be a disadvantageous gas deal with Russia .
The verdict is not yet final ; the court will hear Tymoshenko &apos;s appeal in December .
Tymoshenko claims the verdict is a political revenge of the regime ; in the West , the trial has also evoked suspicion of being biased .
The proposal to remove Article 365 from the Code of Criminal Procedure , upon which the former Prime Minister was sentenced , was supported by 147 members of parliament .
Its ratification would require 226 votes .
Libya &apos;s Victory
The story of Libya &apos;s liberation , or rebellion , already has its defeated .
Muammar Kaddafi is buried at an unknown place in the desert . Without him , the war is over .
It is time to define the winners .
As a rule , Islamists win in the country ; the question is whether they are the moderate or the radical ones .
The transitional cabinet declared itself a follower of the customary Sharia law , of which we have already heard .
Libya will become a crime free country , as the punishment for stealing is having one &apos;s hand amputated .
Women can forget about emancipation ; potential religious renegades will be executed ; etc .
Instead of a dictator , a society consisting of competing tribes will be united by Koran .
Libya will be in an order we cannot imagine and surely would not ask for .
However , our lifestyle is neither unique nor the best one and would not , most probably , be suitable for , for example , the people of Libya .
In fact , it is a wonder that the Islamic fighters accepted help from the nonbelievers .
Their only excuse is that from their point of view , NATO raids were not controlled by an American general , but Allah , the greatness of whom they celebrated with each strike .
When winners are sought for in Libya , the West is not on the list .
We participated in a shooting , served Islam , and our politicians got rid of a dictator , their political ally , without any guarantee of profit .
Given the recent bad experience from Afghanistan and Iraq , we decided against military occupation of Libya .
The locals thus do not have to worry about expelling of the &quot; crusaders . &quot;
Without the occupation , will the oil companies get Libya &apos;s black gold for next to nothing , though ?
It is quite likely that they will not . The West will then finally be able to boast about its selfless protection of human rights .
Unless the followers of the Sharia law put a stop to that .
New Era of Crisis Commences
France and the rest of Europe are now in the investors &quot; spotlight .
A statistical storm blew over Europe on Tuesday .
Individual countries released their 3Q GDP data .
Between quarters , the Czech economy stagnated ; Germany and France are growing .
Yet the debit market is breaking records today .
Investors are no longer looking at only Italy ; they now focus on Spain , France , Austria , and others .
Eurozone statistical offices in Germany , Czech Republic , and some other countries , released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter .
Germany &apos;s GDP has grown by the expected 0.5 % ; and France &apos;s by 0.4 % .
Both countries also adjusted their second quarter data , where Germany did better than expected ( a 0.3 % increase instead of the original 0.1 % ) . France reported a slight decrease , by 0.1 % ( the original information suggested stagnation ) .
In this year &apos;s third quarter , the Czech economy showed an interim increase of 1.5 % .
Between the quarters though , the GDP stagnated . According to the Czech Statistical Office , this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowing of economic growth .
The results are worse than estimates by analysts .
Key events :
In this year &apos;s third quarter , Czech economy showed an interim increase of 1.5 % ; however , it stagnated between the quarters .
Based on preliminary and seasonal data , in the third quarter , the German economy grew by 0.5 % .
Between July and September , the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union grew , compared to the previous quarter , by 0.2 % , which corresponds with estimates by analysts .
The Greek economy showed an interim decrease of 5.2 % .
The earnings on its 10-year bonds are 28.45 % .
Earnings of both Italian and Spanish bonds are growing towards critical limits .
Even Austria , Netherlands , France , and Belgium , etc. are beginning to experience problems .
Despite the fact that the situation in the region is getting worse , earnings of Czech 1 - year bonds stay under 4 % .
Voices are coming from Germany , suggesting that ECB be the last resort creditor .
Czechs qualified for EURO .
In Montenegro they won 1 : 0 and celebrate a 200 million windfall .
Football representation successfully managed the toughest task of the season !
Thanks to both the great Čech and beautiful goal of Petr Jiráček , they won 1 : 0 .
In the second half , Czech football was lucky to maintain its luxury lead from the home return match , and will again feature at the European Championship .
IHNED.cz watched the progress match in a detailed report .
Nearly no excitement in the first half , and a great portion of luck in the other .
Czech representation team , partially due to the home team &apos;s failure in the close ; the great Čech ; and heroic Jiráček ; won 1 : 0 in Montenegro , and celebrates moving on to the European Championship .
Perfect Czech team defence only allowed the Montenegro team to threaten in the second half .
Damjanovic and Vucinic became the match &apos;s least lucky couple after losing two great opportunities .
The wonderful Petr Čech is one of the reasons the Czech representation team will not miss the next year &apos;s European Championship . And Czech football will thus gain nearly 200 million Czech Crowns .
From the opening minutes , the game was very pugnacious .
Both teams found it difficult to join in the combination ; the game remained around the mid-field line most of the time .
That was also why there was no pressure from the home team in the first half . Long kicks behind the defence were neatly averted by the Czech defence .
Iranian Students Are Prepared to Die for Their Country &apos;s Nuclear Program
They created a live shield .
Several hundred university students created a live chain around the nuclear power plant in Iran .
The gesture is to express their support of their country &apos;s nuclear program against a possible Israel attack .
At Tuesday noon , students &apos; prayers in front of the building were followed by their chanting of death to both the USA and Israel .
In Isfahan , Iran , several hundred university students created a live chain around Isfahan Uranium Conversion Facility .
This way , they express their readiness to protect their country &apos;s nuclear program with their own lives .
In its recent report , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) stated that everything leads to the conclusion that Iran has not stopped striving for a nuclear weapon .
Possible attack on Iran nuclear facilities has been discussed in Israel .
At Tuesday noon , students &apos; prayers in front of the entrance into Isfahan Uranium Conversion Facility were followed by their chanting of death to both the USA and Israel .
In case of an attack , aimed at the highest possible paralysation of the Iranian nuclear program , the targets would be , based on Israel press , the facilities in both Isfahan and Natanz , where the uranium is being enriched .
An Obese Child &apos;s Diet : No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Over a third of children between 9 and 13 are overweight ; while 9 % of schoolchildren are overweight , 5 % are obese .
As a recent research shows , obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle .
Again , we can see the importance of the environment and models surrounding a human being for his or her healthy development .
For example , sausages occur up to half more frequently on the tables of obese children compared to the families of children with standard weight .
Over 19 % of obese children had fried chips for dinner the day before the research connected to the educational event called Obesity is No Accident .
Moreover , the families of obese children do not practise sports . However , this concerns a majority of families of current schoolchildren - only 15 % of the children said their parents find time for sports activities at least once a week .
The research was performed among 900 children .
The research took place at the end of last year &apos;s school year ; it included almost 900 elementary school children from throughout Bohemia .
It was the second year of the Obesity is No Accident event supported by both Všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna insurance company and Unilever .
So far , the project has been joined by over 12 thousand school children from 4th to 8th grades .
Proper diet and sufficient sports activities represent key defining factors causing dramatically growing number of children who are either overweight or obese .
&quot; For example , only half of those inquired said they have five meals a day , in the breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner pattern , one of the basic preconditions of correct diet , &quot; one of the results of the research says .
No lunch and sausage in the evening
Experts warn that even relative details are crucial for healthy development ; such as a regular time of family breakfast .
In the Czech Republic , only 23 % of schoolchildren &apos;s families have breakfast together .
In a majority of families , everyone has breakfast separately .
The worst discovery was the fact that in one tenth of households people do not have breakfast at all .
Yet breakfast is the core of proper daily diet .
A survey has shown that fries are consumed more often in the families of obese children .
Nearly everyone - regardless of their weight - drinks sweet soft drinks every day ( 70 % ) .
Though over 40 % of children do sports regularly , the number drops down to less than a half - 15 % - when it comes to their parents .
Compose your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children ( 204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools ) to compose their own menu based on selection offered and their taste and opinions .
&quot; Diet preferences of Czech children between 12 and 15 are far from ideal as regards healthy diet . &quot;
Their favourite meals include large number of flour , meat , and sweet dishes .
&quot; Especially alarming is the high popularity of sweet soft drinks , &quot; the final report of the survey concludes .
As the main dish for lunch , pasta won very tightly over poultry .
However , children showed very little interest in legumes , fish , and vegetable lunches .
Tendency towards health
The survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits provided they are given correct information .
&quot; Many participants from the survey control group showed a significant shift of preferences towards healthy food when completing a questionnaire after the end of the Obesity is No Accident educational lecture , &quot; project results show .
This was quite significant , for example , in case of sweet soft drinks , where more children would begin to prefer plain water .
In addition , for their main course , children ticked poultry and fish more often , limiting sweet meals and dumplings .
A Stylist Must Also Be a Good Psychologist , Professionals Claim
In the opening article on stylist training , I was complaining a bit about the amount of information in the introductory lessons .
I had no idea what was coming .
Lectures by three experts from the field ; dressing tips for difficult figures ; and a seminar on how it works in practise .
And more is yet to come .
The closer we get to the final exam , the more information and practical tasks await .
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday , but it is really packed with information .
This time , together with Alenka , the Director , ( there is not a single man in the course ) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not in perfect symmetry .
A majority of women are not perfectly symmetrical .
One has a short neck , the other has a boyish figure without proper curves , yet another is overweight .
A stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders , make the neck look longer , or add the curves necessary .
We were given tips on how to accentuate the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez , i.e. with bigger breasts and hips and narrow waist , and not to dress them too provocatively .
For example , if the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers do not fit , it is worth to have at least one piece custom-made .
You will definitely not regret the investment , as perfectly fitting clothes are priceless .
In a custom-made skirt , you will feel much better than in one that keeps shifting , rolling up , sticking out in your waist , etc .
Boyish figures , on the other hand , can wear clothes with ruffling , appliqué , embroidery , or shirring .
Given the abundance of such information and figure types , I am glad to have a whole week to sort it all out in my head .
Still , I fear it is too much , with regard to the homework we were given .
Each of the course participants was given a celebrity to create two outfits for : day and night .
We must consider their current appearance , their fashion style , and figure type .
I am to dress Miranda Kerr whom you may know from the Victoria &apos;s Secret campaigns .
Inside I rejoice , as she is so much easier to dress than , say , Britney Spears , Christina Aguilera , who has recently gained about a ton ( please , understand I am exaggerating ) , or the very young Selena Gomez .
We must cut the clothes out of magazines or find them on the Internet and print and graphically process them .
Moodboard , as the result is called , then expresses our personal style and attitude to graphic depiction .
It is important to think about the graphic part of styling .
A stylist does not just dress physical people , but creates product pages in magazines ( based on specific instructions , for example , trendy purses , coats , etc . ) .
This is what a stylist and designer , Mario Kameník , was telling us about .
But that was not until Sunday .
A stylist needs general knowledge
Saturday &apos;s lecture , filled with information on figure types , was livened up by three guests from the field .
A stylist , Honza Pokorný ; a fashion designer , Jakub Polanka ; and a fashion photographer , Ben Renč .
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion , and a stylist should be able to use this fact .
A good stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in different ways .
In this case , variability is key .
For example , a trench coat may be worn in the standard way , over jeans and T-shirt , as a coat ; but it may also be worn on naked body , with step-ins , as a dress .
Another option is rolling up the sleeves or collar , and the entire look changes completely .
&quot; Play with it , &quot; he emphasised .
However , I appreciated the following advice the most : &quot; For your work , you need to know the rules perfectly . &quot;
&apos;Then you can start breaking them , &apos; Jakub told us .
Here I finally understood why we drill all the definitions and rules of what to combine with what and why , while in fashion magazines we often see something else .
Not to mention fashion shows .
From Ben , the photographer , I learned that a stylist must have more outfit versions prepared than the number he is to take pictures of .
So , for a ten-page fashion story ( equals ten outfits ) , I have to be ready to create at least fifteen of them .
Now I also know that in the picture , a piece of clothing often looks and functions in combination with others completely different from reality .
We must therefore take that into consideration when creating an outfit .
Honza Pokorný confirmed that image and style often are half the success .
Just look at Madonna , who is no miraculous singer , yet her image and marketing turned her into a worldwide star .
The attitude towards stylist services is still rather cold in the Czech Republic .
Even famous people often consider it redundant ( believing it is sufficient to be good at something , and how they look at it comes second ) .
And if someone finally lets us create their styling , then we should expect them to give us different ( smaller ) size than what they really wear .
Then , we are left to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote something about a celebrity gaining / losing weight , etc .
On Sunday , both Honza and Mario were stressing the fact that for a stylist it is not enough to know about fashion and be able to create an outfit .
Our work chiefly consists of communicating with people we dress ; it is therefore important to be a good psychologist .
To be able to estimate people , not to pander , and stick to one &apos;s opinion .
&quot; If a manager asks you to go through her clothes and add some nice pieces , you cannot throw out her entire wardrobe telling her how awful the clothes are . &quot;
&quot; Find at least a few pieces you can praise , and recommend what to wear them with &quot; Mario says .
He also showed us what specifically a duty bag must contain .
That is the bag you fasten around your waist to carry all the props you need .
Aside from the obvious things , such as scissors , a sticky roller , or safety pins , it should have a nylon thread ( for the stylist to use when taking pictures of products such as purses or hats ) , special clip-ons for holding the clothes in the back in case it is too large ( pins and similar things are forbidden as they damage the clothes ) , or a sewing set .
To have some change from listening , and gain some practical experience , we learned how to properly underlay shoe soles .
Even when taking photographs in a studio where the surface is even , the soles might get damaged - not to mention shooting outside .
And so we were sticking away .
You must not touch the shoes with the scissors , to avoid any damage .
This requires real skill .
Mario pleased me by praising my job .
The skills mentioned are really not my cup of tea .
This is just a fragment of what we heard during the second weekend course session .
I am beginning to realise that to be a professional stylist is no piece of cake , no matter what people say .
V Need for Speed : The Run takes place across America .
Review
An originally carefree ride turned into a routine morning drive to work because of a series of completely superfluous and sloppy mistakes .
The ambitions were met to a certain point , but it does not matter since nobody obviously wanted to do any extra work .
Before it was released , the new version subtitled The Run created high expectations .
It promised to shift the old Need For Speed racing series in a new direction ; the demos made it look like a game that might stand up in the action racing genre .
We were curious to see the sections where the main character gets out of the car and runs .
Typical for the NFS series though , in the end many things are different from what we expected .
The game represents a possibly decent arcade race , but the whole is burdened by several unnecessary mistakes featured in the series for a number of years .
This means they are not really mistakes , but the expression of an incomprehensible laziness of the developers .
The adventure opens very well .
You are introduced into a story , where the main character , Jack , decides to solve some personal issues by participating in an illegal race across America .
You get in the car on the west coast , in San Francisco , and your task is to be the first one to reach New York .
The idea brings several interesting features .
The route is divided into ten stages , subdivided into over fifty races .
This means each race takes place on a different route , and given stages are set in varied and interesting environments .
One thus does not feel the game keeps offering the same things .
Despite the graphics being on the same level of previous parts of the series , some of the environments are very nice to look at .
Still , it is nothing world-shattering .
Driving through the desert , autumnal countryside , or high in snow-covered mountains is visually very pleasant though .
In addition , the races are , from time to time , enlivened by an untypical feature .
For example , in the desert , you get into a sandstorm , significantly decreasing the visibility .
